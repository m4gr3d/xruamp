XR Universal Android Music Player Sample
========================================
The sample shows how to implement a XR audio media app that works and provides a 
consistent user experience on XR devices like the [Meta Quest](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oculus_Quest) 
and on regular Android devices by using the [Godot XRApp framework](https://github.com/m4gr3d/GAST/tree/master/core/src/xrapp). 

To find out how to integrate the [Godot XRApp framework](https://github.com/m4gr3d/GAST/tree/master/core/src/xrapp)
in an Android app, please check the [Usage section](https://github.com/m4gr3d/GAST/tree/master/core/src/xrapp#usage).

This sample is based off the [UAMP](https://github.com/android/uamp) sample.
